here is a simple description of how to run these files and how they work
This project is a simple shellbased system that helps to  identify the  students who have not submitted their assignments.
The create_environment.sh script  sets up the entire working environment with all the required folders/directories and files. 
Once the setup is done, the startup.sh script launches the app, updates permissions, 
and displays the current assignment details along with a list of students who still need to submit.
The copilot_shell_script.sh allows you to modify the current ssignment name in the configuration file and
then restarts the reminder automatically.
